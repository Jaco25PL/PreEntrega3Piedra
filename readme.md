# E-Commerce Project (frontend)

This is my final project for **Coderhouse**. I built a fully functional online shop website using only **frontend** technologies like `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JavaScript`. No backend or database needed for this project

## Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that represents the home page of the e-commerce website.
- `cart.html`: The HTML file that represents the cart page where users can view and manage their cart items.
- `main.js`: The main JavaScript file that contains the core functionality of the e-commerce application.
- `store.json`: The JSON file that contains the product data used in the application.

## Project Features

- **Product Listing**: Users can browse through the available products, view their details, and add them to the cart.
- **Currency Conversion**: Using an currency conversion API, the user can change between USD and UYU.
- **Cart Management**: Users can add products to the cart, view the cart contents, remove items from the cart, and proceed to checkout.
- **Search Functionality**: Users can search for specific products by brand or model.
- **User Registration**: Users can register their name and telephone number for checkout purposes.

## Conclusion

The e-commerce project provides a basic implementation of an online shopping experience. Users can browse products, add them to the cart, and proceed to checkout. The project can be further enhanced and customized to meet specific requirements and integrate with real-world e-commerce functionalities such as payment gateways, user authentication, product inventory management, and database. Feel free to add value.
